  <p> Hello, my name is Holly Flynn, and I'm a third-semester student in the Digital Technology & Design program at Arkansas State University. My concentration is in web design. Ever since I was young, I liked creating art on the computer, whether on Paint or designing basic sites with HTML and CSS without realizing at the time that I was in fact practicing coding. I've always had an internal compass for designing and aesthetics, I think; when I was in kindergarten, I won an all-county award for coloring a singing chicken (yes, you read that right). The reason I won was because although the coloring was mediocre, I drew stars and hearts, which weren't part of the original outline. So, I guess you could say my approach to art is "looking" outside the box.
